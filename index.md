I'm a 3rd year PhD student in Economics at the University of Pennsylvania.
I'm broadly interested in applied microeconomic theory with empirical applications.
My current research studies the effects of political correctness on social learning in social networks.

I also love computers and code! I get excited about

- linux
- vim
- python
- julia
- and more...

I'm involved with running [Penn Effective Altruism](http://pennea.org), a student group that focuses on the most effective ways to improve the world.
I manage the website and help run the new [80,000 Hours](http://pennea.org/80k-hours) chapter.
