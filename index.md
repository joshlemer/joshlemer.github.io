I'm a Software Engineer in Vancouver, Canada. I currently work at [EnerNOC](http://www.enernoc.com/), creating back end services and infastructure. I mostly work with [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) and [Akka](http://www.akka.io) these days.

I get excited about

- linux
- functional programming
- distributed and concurrent computing
- plants
- Open Source software
- physics and astronomy
- cycling
- economics
- and more...

I'm involved with running [Penn Effective Altruism](http://pennea.org), a student group that focuses on the most effective ways to improve the world.
I manage the website and run the new [80,000 Hours](http://pennea.org/80k-hours) chapter.
